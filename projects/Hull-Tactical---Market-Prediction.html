            <!-- <p class="post-meta">September 2025 Â· 5 min read</p> -->

            <p>
                I'm currently participating in the Hull Tactical - Market Prediction
                competition on Kaggle. The challenge involves forecasting an allocation
                value between 0 and 2, representing exposure to the S&P 500 versus cash.
            </p>

            <p>
                The objective is to design a model that dynamically adjusts this allocation
                based on historical and market-related features, effectively simulating an
                active portfolio management strategy.
            </p>

            <p>
                The competition is evaluated using a modified Sharpe ratio, which penalizes
                models that either take on substantially more volatility than the market
                or fail to outperform its returns. This metric emphasises risk-adjusted
                performance, rewarding stable and consistent predictions rather than 
                aggressive or overfit strategies.
            </p>

            <p>
                My work so far has focussed on:
                <ul>
                    <li>Feature engineering for time-series and market indicators</li>
                    <li>Model experimentation, including ensemble and deep learning approaches</li>
                    <li>Portfolio-simulation techniques to better align predictions with the
                        competition's risk-based metric</li>
                </ul>
                Since the competition is still ongoing, my repository is currently private.
                Once it concludes, I plan to make the code and analysis publically available.
